# Pillar IV: Translation

### RP3 is now engaged in clinical development of its lead drugs. Primary focus is RP3â€™s CNS portfolio:

### **Innovative Pipeline of Drugs**

| **Agent**  | **Target** | **Drug Class** | **Indication** |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **3r1**    | GPCR       | Agonist        | Amblyopia      |
| **866**    | GPCR       | Agonist        | Tinnitus       |
| **JM-484** | GPCR       | Antagonist     | Epilepsy       |

- **3R1** is a novel small molecule agonist targeting a GPCR in the visual cortex of the brain for the treatment and cure for childhood and adult **Amblyopia**;
- **866** is a new small molecule agonist against a GPCR in the audio cortex of the brain for the treatment and cure of **Tinnitus**;
- **JM-484** is a small molecule antagonist targeting a GPCR in the neocortex of the brain as a novel approach for treating **Epilepsy**

### Developmental stages
