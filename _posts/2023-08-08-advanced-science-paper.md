## Abstract

Studies in recent years have highlighted an elaborate crosstalk between T cells and bone cells, suggesting that T cells may be alternative therapeutic targets for the maintenance of bone homeostasis. Here, it is reported that systemic administration of low-dose staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2) 2M-118, a form of mutant superantigen, dramatically alleviates ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss via modulating T cells. Specially, SEC2 2M-118 treatment increases trabecular bone mass significantly via promoting bone formation in OVX mice. These beneficial effects are largely diminished in T-cell-deficient nude mice and can be rescued by T-cell reconstruction. Neutralizing assays determine interferon gamma (IFN-γ) as the key factor that mediates the beneficial effects of SEC2 2M-118 on bone. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that IFN-γ stimulates Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling, leading to enhanced production of nitric oxide, which further activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) signaling and promotes osteogenic differentiation. IFN-γ also directly inhibits osteoclast differentiation, but this effect is counteracted by pro-absorptive factors tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) secreted from IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages. Taken together, this work provides clues for developing innovative approaches which target T cells for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.
