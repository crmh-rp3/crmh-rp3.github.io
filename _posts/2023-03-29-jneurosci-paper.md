## Abstract

Cholecystokinin (CCK) enables excitatory circuit long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we investigated its involvement in the enhancement of inhibitory synapses. Activation of GABA neurons suppressed neuronal responses in the neocortex to a forthcoming auditory stimulus in mice of both sexes. High-frequency laser stimulation (HFLS) of GABAergic neurons potentiated this suppression. HFLS of CCK interneurons could induce the LTP of their inhibition toward pyramidal neurons. This potentiation was abolished in CCK knock-out mice but intact in mice with both CCK1R and 2R knockout of both sexes. Next, we combined bioinformatics analysis, multiple unbiased cell-based assays, and histology examinations to identify a novel CCK receptor, GPR173. We propose GPR173 as CCK3R, which mediates the relationship between cortical CCK interneuron signaling and inhibitory LTP in the mice of either sex. Thus, GPR173 might represent a promising therapeutic target for brain disorders related to excitation and inhibition imbalance in the cortex.

## Significance Statement

CCK, the most abundant and widely distributed neuropeptide in the CNS, colocalizes with many neurotransmitters and modulators. GABA is one of the important inhibitory neurotransmitters, and much evidence shows that CCK may be involved in modulating GABA signaling in many brain areas. However, the role of CCK-GABA neurons in the cortical microcircuits is still unclear. We identified a novel CCK receptor, GPR173, localized in the CCK-GABA synapses and mediated the enhancement of the GABA inhibition effect, which might represent a promising therapeutic target for brain disorders related to excitation and inhibition imbalance in the cortex.
